# ProjectFlow

## Introduction

This is a RESTful API for managing projects and tasks. It provides endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting projects and tasks, as well as for assigning tasks to users and tracking their progress. The API is designed to be used by developers who are building project management applications or integrating project management functionality into existing applications.
